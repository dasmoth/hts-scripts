HTS Scripts
===========

A collection of mostly-Java scripts and tools for processing high-throughput sequencing data, gradually being dredged from my private repository!

Getting started
---------------

If you're running on Linux, you'll likely need to download and install Sun Java:

        http://java.sun.com/

You'll also need Ant to compile this:

        http://ant.apache.org/

Type 

      ant

To build the system.  Should produce a file named `hts-scripts.jar`.  Add this, plus the contents of the `lib` directory to your `CLASSPATH` and you should be good to go.
